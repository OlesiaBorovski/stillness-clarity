        This piece makes the listener’s perception change by gradually shifting sound textures and levels of attention.
        At the beginning, we hear mostly noise, with a violin melody hidden underneath. Because the melody is not clear,
        the listener is encouraged to listen more carefully. With closer attention, it becomes clear that the noise also
        contains fragments of voices, such as radio or advertisements. Even though the sound feels continuous at first,
        small changes in intensity create a sense of ambiguous discontinuity.
      </p>

      <p>
        The first major change happens when a fast, sharp sound suddenly interrupts the texture. This contrast is very
        strong, so it can be described as a radical discontinuity. As this interrupting sound repeats more often, it
        becomes less surprising. Over time, the listener starts to expect it, turning the interruption into a
        progressive continuity. The repetition increases intensity and leads to a climax, making the next change feel
        less extreme.
      </p>

      <p>
        The following section introduces inverted human voices. At first, they sound confusing, but repetition organizes
        them into a pattern. A short silence separates this section from the next, where the voices return and form a
        second vocal melody. Each repetition contains small breaks, but together they create an unstable continuity
        because the intensity keeps changing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Later, the sound shifts to a more melodic section based mainly on steel tongue drum sounds. Since the listener
        is already used to change, this transition does not feel sudden or aggressive. In the final part, the piece
        slowly returns to the original noise. This ending mirrors the beginning in an inverted way. The interrupting
        sound appears again, but less frequently, until it is heard one last time, bringing the piece to an end.
